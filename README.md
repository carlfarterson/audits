- WhalerDAO
- Smart contracts of first project called TREE
    - Similar to YAM/AMPL
    - Addresses supply based on current price
    - Difference between tree/YA
        - No minted rebased
        - for positive rebased, instead of changed balances they mint new tokens
        to sell on uniswap,
        - As a holder of TREE you can "ragequit" to burn your supply
        - Quadratic burning
        - Incentived for others to burn first
- Beetoken, fantastic 12, 88mph
